# task_manager_tutorial 
#it's designed for educational purposes

*This is a simple task manager (time scheduler) for implementing in embedded systems that do not support OS. 
*The code only manages the time for executing tasks without controlling resource.
*The systick_handler is a simulation of base timer in MCUs. You must replace its body with your code to have base time with interrupts.
*The code can be designed better than the current version and I have some ideas to make it professional. If you interested in them feel free to contact me by
